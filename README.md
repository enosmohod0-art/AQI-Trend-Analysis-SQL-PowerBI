📊 Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis – India | Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Air Quality Index (AQI) trends across India (2020–2025) using PostgreSQL and Power BI.
The objective was to perform structured SQL-based analysis and present insights through a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard focused on trends, comparisons, and pollution severity.

The project emphasizes analytical thinking and clarity, not over-engineering.

🎯 Problem Statement

Air pollution in India varies significantly across time, cities, and regions.
This project answers key questions such as:

How has AQI changed year-by-year and month-by-month?

Which cities are consistently most polluted?

How does Delhi NCR compare with the rest of India?

Which cities face stable vs highly volatile pollution?

Are pollution hotspots geographically clustered?

🧠 Analysis Approach

Data was queried and aggregated using PostgreSQL

Separate SQL queries were written for:

Year-level AQI trends

Month-level AQI trends

City-level averages

Pollution ranking

Volatility analysis

Power BI was used strictly for:

Visualization

Interactivity (slicers, filters)

Insight communication

No unnecessary modeling or over-complex DAX logic was used.

📄 Dashboard Pages & Key Insights
1️⃣ National AQI Overview

Year-wise and month-wise AQI trends

Dynamic year selection

Insight:
AQI shows strong seasonal behavior, with pollution levels worsening during winter months. Recent years show fluctuations rather than consistent improvement.

2️⃣ City-Wise AQI Comparison

Average AQI comparison across cities

Insight:
Certain cities consistently record higher AQI, indicating structural pollution issues rather than temporary spikes.

3️⃣ Delhi NCR vs Rest of India

Comparison of unhealthy air quality severity

Insight:
Delhi NCR experiences a significantly higher pollution burden compared to the national average.

4️⃣ Volatility vs Consistency Analysis

Comparison of average AQI vs pollution volatility

Insight:
Cities with higher AQI often show higher volatility, making pollution less predictable and harder to manage.

5️⃣ Pollution Ranking & Map View

Year-wise ranking of most polluted cities

Geographic visualization of top polluted locations

Insight:
Although rankings change yearly, a small group of cities frequently appears among the most polluted.
