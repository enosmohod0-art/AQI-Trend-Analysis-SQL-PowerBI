## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes 378K+ AQI records across India from 2020 to 2025 to evaluate:

- National air quality trends  
- Monthly and yearly pollution patterns  
- City-level pollution rankings  
- Regional severity comparisons (Delhi NCR vs Rest of India)  
- AQI volatility across cities  

The goal was to create a structured, interactive dashboard that provides clear environmental insights for public awareness and data-driven decision-making.

- Year-wise pollution ranking using DENSE_RANK()
- Identification of high-risk cities (e.g., Sonipat)

### 4️⃣ Regional Severity Analysis
- Comparison between Delhi NCR and Rest of India
- % of unhealthy AQI days calculation
- AQI severity categorization (Good → Severe)

### 5️⃣ Volatility Analysis
- Standard deviation of AQI per city
- Identifying cities with high pollution fluctuation
